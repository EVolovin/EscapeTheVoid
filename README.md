**Escape the VOID**

            *by Eugene Volovin*
  
  

  

"In space, no one can hear you scream" or so they say...

There is no walls in this labyrinth. The Void does not need them to contain you...

Escape it or be consumed by it.

Bevare of the meteors over your head.

And you might as well want to watch your step.
